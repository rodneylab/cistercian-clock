# If you want to use the bleeding edge version of egui and eframe:
# egui = { git = "https://github.com/emilk/egui", branch = "master" }
# eframe = { git = "https://github.com/emilk/egui", branch = "master" }

# If you fork https://github.com/emilk/egui you can test with:
# egui = { path = "../egui/crates/egui" }
# eframe = { path = "../egui/crates/eframe" }
